My daily solutions to the festive tradition that is [*Advent of Code, 2023* (https://adventofcode.com/2023/)](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). 

I'm a C# developer so all these have been build as .NET 8 console applications concentrating on result rather than looking aesthetically pleasing but you should still find the code itself perfectly readable / understandable.

I enjoy the challenge of being presented with requirements, designing a solution, coding, debuging and then delivering a result within a timeframe. Who said being a developer was just code, code and more code!
